## Inspiration

As students, time is our most valuable asset. For this reason, students are opting out of shopping in person in stores and moving to Amazon and other onlines stores for their shopping needs. This places strain on local business and retail stores to adapt. Drawing inspiration from services like Uber, Lyft, UberEats and many others, we believe we can implement a service that allows buyers to shop vicariously through a network of shoppers near registered retail locations. This provides small businesses additional traffic, shoppers a form of side income, and users the ability to shop locally effortlessly. Our service also integrates with the postal service pipeline by shortcutting the process and allowing postal personnel to deliver directly to the consumer, removing the need for costly handling.

## What it does

Connects users looking to fulfil their shopping needs from the comfort of their own home. Our service connects shoppers with buyers, to fast track the delivery pipeline.

## How I built it

- Web App built with React, Node.js
- User authentication and transaction with Blockstack

## Challenges I ran into

The biggest challenge for our team was implementing Pub/Sub to handle communication between user's and shoppers. It was difficult to find the appropriate resources that would allow us to implement our features.

## What I learned

Through this process, our team gained a greater understanding of React and pub/sub architectures.

## What's next for Shop N'Buy

Recruiting stores and retail outlets for our service and integrating Canada Post services for deliveries.
